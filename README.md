# Cervical_Cancer 

**Cervical_Cancer** is a machine-learning/data-science project aimed at predicting risk or outcomes of cervical cancer using patient data and features. It uses [dataset description, model types, etc] to build a predictive model and foster understanding of cervical cancer risk factors.

## Repository Structure

Here’s a breakdown of the key files and folders (update according to your actual structure):


##  Features & Goals

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of cervical-cancer risk dataset (e.g., from UCI or equivalent) such as demographic, medical history, STDs, etc. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- Building classification (or regression) models to predict cervical cancer risk / early detection using machine-learning algorithms.  
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, ROC/AUC.  
- (Optional) Feature-importance or interpretability to highlight key risk-factors.  
- Serving as a portfolio piece for your skills in data science/ML, aligned with your goals.

##  Why this Project?

- The incidence of cervical cancer remains a significant global health challenge: it’s the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- Machine learning offers opportunities to assist screening, risk-stratification and early detection.  
- For you (Ananya Satyapal), it’s a strong demonstration of your data science journey (you plan to master ML & DL) and a meaningful domain: public health impact, not just “toy” data.

##  Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ananyasatyapal08/Cervical_Cancer.git
cd Cervical_Cancer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
